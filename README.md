## Memory Management
> With the current version of NativeScript we are using, we run into a memory leak issue, a.k.a. the app crashes and auto-exits after being used for a period of time, especially when lots of between-page navigation is happening. To fix this issue, we manually clear app memory every half second using nativescript's memory settings. There are two options to setup scheduled manually memory cleaning.[nativescript's documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/android-runtime/advanced-topics/memory-management). This app is currently using the first option.
1. Via Schedule :watch:
	- "gcThrottleTime": 500
2. Via Ratio :heavy_division_sign:
	- "memoryCheckInterval": 500,
	- "freeMemoryRatio": 0.20
